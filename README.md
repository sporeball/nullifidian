# nullifidian
**nullifidian** is a fork of the [agnoster theme](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-agnoster) for [fish](https://fishshell.com), with all unnecessary additions removed, and very few other changes made.

here is a list of all the things nullifidian **removes** from agnoster:
- hostname, root and jobs segments
- virtual environment prompt
- Mercurial / Subversion status
- vi mode indication
- source control blacklist
- special characters / emoji

if you need any of these things, you should use the original instead.
